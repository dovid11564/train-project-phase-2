This project was made by Alexander Newson and Dovid Edelkopf for our phase 2 project at Flatiron School. 

We built this app as a front end react project to show off our skills as front end developers. 

To run this app on your own computer, please run these commands:

```sh
npm install
json-server --watch db.json
```
In a new terminal, please run:
```sh
npm start
```
